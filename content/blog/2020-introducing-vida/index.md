*Vida Team Mission: Make data science accessible across the web*

Seven years ago, we built a data visualization product based on d3js. The product was not successful. It was difficult for non-programmer to work with JavaScript data visualizations. Our mission was to make data science accessible across the web. We did not find a path to achieve this mission. The first generation data science tools face many obstacle:

- There was a lot of hype.
- JavaScript was immature. It was difficult to reuse code.
- Tools are fragmented. You can use Python, R for data analysis, then have to switch to JavaScript for visualization.

Fast forward to 2020, we see new changes in JavaScript. React allows new ways to make reusable web components. Web technology is moving towards CDN and serverless architecture. We can create scalable and reusable data visualizations. We are excited to be back with a new visualization product.

This is the beginning of our new journey. Our product, Vida, allows users to turn a JSON spec file into a visualization dashboard. We want to make it easy for users to integrate data analysis and visualization using JavaScript.
